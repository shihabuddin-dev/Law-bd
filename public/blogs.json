      "question": "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components. Which one is better?",
      "answer": "Controlled components are form elements whose values are managed by React state, while uncontrolled components store their own state internally using refs. Controlled components offer more control and are easier to validate and test, making them generally the better choice for complex forms.",

      "question": "What is the Virtual DOM in React and why is it important?",
      "answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM in React. It allows React to efficiently update the UI by computing the difference (diffing) between the new Virtual DOM and the previous one, and only applying the necessary changes to the real DOM, improving performance.",
